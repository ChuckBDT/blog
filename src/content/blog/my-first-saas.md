Even if this blog is just starting and there's a lot of improvements to do, I wanted to start a new saas. Something technically challenging.

This blog is built with Astro using [their blog template](https://astro.build/themes/details/blog/), the goal here was to learn how Astro works and build a blog at the same time. 
## How to find an idea?
I guess that's the big problem for a lot of solo developers, ready to build, but build what ?

I woke up this morning with a funny idea : "Why not discuss with Claude and see where it goes?".

After a chat — strange as it feels to say 'we' about a machine and myself — the idea emerged.
## Find a problem first
A few years ago I ran a computer repair shop.

I worked alone and performed various services : Assembly, Windows setups, optimizations, virus cleanings etc...

This whole time, I worked with papers to track the customer's machines, diagnostics and ... It was a bit messy. 

I mean, during the operation it was okay but papers would pile up, mix together, and get lost.

The real issue came after, some of my customers were "regulars" as relationships developed. They brought a laptop, then a station, then the son's laptop, the wife's iPad... With months between operations.

Remembering what had been done on what machine and when was nearly impossible.

## The solution
I guess you saw it coming, I'm going to build a small saas to handle and track all the workflow of the computer repair shops.

It will be very fun to do and can be incremental : I can start by a simple dashboard with a form to add customers and machines with notes and then repair statuses, notes, billing state ... A lot of features.

## But ... It already exists!
I know. If you're looking for valid and complete solutions there's [RepairDesk](https://www.repairdesk.co/), [RepairShopr](https://www.repairshopr.com/) or [mHelpDesk](https://www.mhelpdesk.com/).

But that's not the way I see things. I always thought that what you do doesn't really matter, what matters is why you do it.

In this particular case, i'm not creating this Saas to replace all the existing solutions in the world and get rich. I'm doing it to create, learn, share and more important : Have fun.

I'm doing it while thinking of all the people that started like me at some point : Alone / with a friend, with a small / no budget for tools. 

If at that time, I had founded a small saas that was doing just the basics, it really would have helped.
## The tools
Right now, I'm working with Cursor and Claude Code. My use of AI is actually really light, i'm not into vibe coding at all. 

I prefer to write code myself and discuss how I can enhance it with AI. Since ChatGPT came out I used it this way and I learned a lot. But since then, a lot of new features have arrived. MCP, n8n, Claude Cowork ... And I surely miss a lot.

It can be the opportunity for me to find the perfect balance between doing and delegating to an AI. 

I feel excited! Thanks for the reading and see you on the next posts to follow this new project!
