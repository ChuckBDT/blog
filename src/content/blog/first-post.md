Well, here we are ... The first post.

I have so many things to write and yet, i don't know where to start.

As an over-thinker, software engineering taught me something really useful : KISS (keep it simple, stupid). I still overthink everything but at least, i'm conscious of it. So i'll try to keep it short and simple.

Spoiler : I won't.

## A needed break

Computers have basically always been part of my life, since as long as i remember, i'm using/fixing/torturing one.

Three years ago, i got into web-development. After a front-end developer diploma at [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/), i was on the market looking for a job.

I got lucky and met [Lucien Leroy Ladurie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucien-le-roy-ladurie-337aa1a1/) CTO of RIDE!, a company that provides launch mission management services and launch opportunities in the space ecosystem.
They had a Saas and were hiring developers to maintain and enhance it.

Awesome experience, i met interesting people from various horizons, learned a lot (a development diploma is like a driving licence, you think you know how to drive when you finally got it, but you don't). 

But after some times, i wanted to do something else.

I got lucky again and met [Léonard Chalvet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/l%C3%A9onard-chalvet-33a47ba5/) Cofounder of Bruno, a branding agency. 

At this time, i was really interested by the web-design world. If computers never really had secrets for me, design always felt like magic. How does it work, what is the secret recipe that generates the beautiful, the different, the feeling.

Another awesome experience, other interesting people, other vibe ... But not mine.

I left 9 months later and felt pretty bad at that time. I left because i knew i wouldn't be happy with them but i also left a nice job in a failing and uncertain job market in which AI is breaking rules everyday.

I needed a serious break and if i look on the bright side, i got lucky again : I had important work to do in my home that could not wait any longer. So i decided to close the computer for a few months.

## Paralysis
So here we are, now. Four months have passed.

I thought a lot, worked a lot with my hands, read a lot too and... Well, nothing has changed. Things got even worse actually.

I came back to LinkedIn and it was the same mess, i search for AI trends and a lot had happened but in the end nothing really concrete and the job market was still broken.

Man, that felt wrong. What am i going to do?

Starting a new dev project ? Why ? To create the 1000000th thing that has already been made by people with more time (and skills) than me ? I know i'm experienced enough now to take a langage / framework, read the doc and do something clean. So what's the point ?

I won't continue here because if you're reading i'm pretty sure you already know the mindset i was in.

## Revelation
OK, i need to stop with those titles or this post will look like a Twilight book. Or i should continue for the fun. 

Once again, i got lucky (that's not bragging, just trying to be positive here) and came across a book : "Les Carnets du Sous-Sol" from Dostoïveski.

I deliberately won't explain the content of this book, you should try to read it and create your own understanding. 

For me it was like a slap in the face. Even if i did not completely identify myself as the main character, i felt many similarities. And worse, i thought something like : "If you don't change, if you keep that mindset, you'll end up like him".

It also answered a question i was asking myself since months : Why most of the people that act, seems not to think before ? Not that they're stupid but they make mistakes that i can see coming from far even if it's not my field of competences.

The answer was simple: Because there's a lot of difference between thinking and acting, theory and practice. That's why.

We are humans and as such, we are not perfect. So we logically can't (or need to work really hard) generate a perfect output.

It's really easy to be away from a situation and think about it. But what about when you're "in" the situation? You can't have a 360° view of it, you need to act fast and so, you make compromises (and inevitably mistakes).

The differences between the one who act and the one who think, is the end of the day. The first one will still be thinking and the second one will have done something. 
It won't be perfect, probably won't be finished too but it will be something and not anything : A human creation.

And isn't that what we are made for ? Create ? Reinvent ? Isn't that the most wonderful thing we can achieve as humans ?

Of course, the goal is to find the right balance between thinking and acting because in both extreme you won't produce anything. Create something without thinking a little before is sure to fail. That's the hardest part for me, finding the right moment to stop thinking and start acting.

As i'm writing this, i notice that actually there is a big psychological thing to dig here. 

The fear of other people's opinion and the fear of losing control. I'm not really concerned by the first one but the second one ... I mean, as long as you think and don't try to realize something, it stays perfect. You keep control on it. This is when you act that your thoughts come into a fight with reality, this is when you lost the control on it.

Everything become possible, the good as the bad, isn't that terrifying ?

## Conclusion
So ... What do i do now ? I mean, since this reflexion the only thing that has changed is me, not the world, not the place that AI is taking, not the job market, only me. 

Back to the beginning.

I decided to take a step, multiple steps actually. I tried to shut this brain down and do, act. 

### This blog
I created this blog for multiple reasons:
- Write code and test new things
- Improve my english writing
- Bring something to the world

For the last reason, i'm not saying i will provide the missing ingredient for a better world. I'm saying that i'm going to try to.

By writing, showing some of my ideas and taking risks, if i help only one person the job is done.

### Running
I'm around 30 now and convinced of one thing, moving is essential. 

For the body, the brain, relationships, work, everything. For too long i minimize the importance of sports activities in my life.

So, in addition of judo that i started last year, i started to run again, alone. To move, to have this little time with myself only.

### Taking care of myself
Eat better, sleep better ... It feels like this Radiohead song "Fitter happier" from [OK Computer](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_Computer) but with a totally different end.

The goal for me is not to be "more productive" i mean, not all the time. 

The goal is to respect my body and enjoy the present moment. Be better when i need to act but also relax when it's not the time. 

Balance issue, again.

## Then ?
Well, who knows ? First this blog. Then i will build something, a little Saas i think.

I want to play again with NodeJS, Express to build an API. Some Docker too.

I will use this blog to document and remember my creations. 

I'm also looking for a new job as a full-stack developer, or maybe i will start a new company, don't know yet! Everything is possible!

Thanks for the reading, see you soon 👋
